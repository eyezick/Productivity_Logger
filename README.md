A log text file is created for every session with the format YEAR-MONTH-DAY-HOUR-MINUTE-TIMEINTERVAL.TXT, and every interval check-in you make, is recorded in this file.

Use this often enough, and with the data you're able to actually graph your levels of productivity over time with great accuracy (down to the minute), and even notice any trends such as times of day or periods during the year you were particularly productive.

Features:

8 Different Personality Profiles for text feedback
Input Validation
Creates Logging Folder "SelfAcct_Logs" where the program is executed from.
